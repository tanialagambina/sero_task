# sero_interview_task
Repository for code and notebook created for the Sero interview task.

Please ensure the function requirements are met as listed in the requirements.txt file.

The Jupyter Notebook is a good place to start as this lays out my intended use of the code package I created for this exercise. I hope my notes in it are self explanatory!

Thanks for taking the time to review :)
