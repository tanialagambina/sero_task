# sero_interview_task
Repository for code and notebook created for the Sero interview task.

Please ensure the function requirements are met as listed in the requirements.txt file.

The Jupyter Notebook is a good place to start as this lays out my intended use of the code package I created for this exercise. 

I have also included an example .pdf output for the analysis. This should be output automatically, but if there are any issues it is there to view too.

Thanks for taking the time to review :)
